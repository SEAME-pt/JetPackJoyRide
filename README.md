# JetpackJoyRide
Main repository of our [SEA:ME](https://seame.space/) team with the objective of building a functioning intelligent mobility system and its documentation.

---

## üìÅ Repo Index

This repo contains several submodules, each tackling a specific component of our intelligent mobility stack‚Äîfrom warm-up exercises to advanced autonomous driving systems.

--- 

### üî∞ [SEAME-WarmUp-24-25](https://github.com/Axel-ex/SEAME-WarmUp-24-25)

First module of the course. Includes C++ exercises to refresh key concepts and an introduction to the **Qt framework**, which we use later to design the infotainment system.

---

### üöò [SEAME-Cluster-24-25](https://github.com/Xyckens/SEAME-Cluster-24-25)

Development of the **Instrument Cluster** for our JetRacer vehicle.

> Qt-based graphical interface displaying real-time vehicle metrics (speed, battery, etc.), communicating over **CAN** and **I2C** using a **Raspberry Pi 4**, with data gathered by an **Arduino Uno ECU**.

**Key Subfolders:**
- `Jetracer`: ROS2 workspace running on the Raspberry Pi.
- `JetRacer_container`: Docker environment to build and run the stack with correct hardware access.
- `ECU_code`: Code for the Arduino Uno acting as the Electronic Control Unit.

**Documentation:** [JetRacer Documentation](https://xyckens.github.io/SEAME-Cluster-24-25/)

---

### ü§ñ [SEAME-ADS-Autonomous-lane-detection-24-25](https://github.com/Axel-ex/SEAME-ADS-Autonomous-lane-detection-24-25)
This project implements an **Autonomous Driving System (ADS)**, integrating **lane detection** with steering control on a JetRacer.

> Combines **computer vision** and **machine learning**, powered by **ROS 2** on a **Jetson Nano** for GPU-accelerated real-time performance.

**Key Features:**
- Modular ROS2 nodes for camera, control, and perception.
- Runs both in **Carla simulator** and in the **real world**.
- Hybrid lane detection (OpenCV + ML).
- Launch tools for real-time or replayed data workflows.

**Documentation**: [Jetracer Documentation](https://axel-ex.github.io/SEAME-ADS-Autonomous-lane-detection-24-25)

### ‚öôÔ∏è  [SEAME-MachineLearningModel_24-25](https://github.com/peterbikes/SEAME-MachineLearningModel_24-25)

Development and training of our **U-Net model** for **lane and object detection**.  

> This repo focuses on model creation, training, and testing before deployment. Models are exported to **ONNX** and later optimized with **TensorRT** for inference on the Jetson Nano.

**Key Folders:**
- `datasets/`: Datasets used for training and evaluation.  
- `srcs_py/`: Python code for model architecture, training pipeline, and ONNX conversion.  
- `srcs_cpp/`: C++ integration code for running the model inside the JetRacer.  
- `tests/`: Debug and verification scripts, mostly in Python.  


---

### ‚ö° [SEAME-ML-Model-Jetson-24-25](https://github.com/Axel-ex/SEAME-ML-Model-Jetson-24-25)

Reference repo for doing inference using TensorRT directly in **C++** on the **Jetson Nano**.

> Used for benchmarking `.engine` files or debugging single inference calls‚Äîgreat for embedded ML deployments.

**Structure:**
- `benchmarking/`: Times multiple engine files and reports inference performance.
- `test_engine/`: Runs inference on a single image (debug-focused).

--- 

### üìÑ [ADR](https://github.com/SEAME-pt/JetPackJoyRide/tree/main/ADR)

The Architecture Decision Record (ADR) folder documents key technical choices we've made throughout the project. These markdown files act as a timeline of our understanding, containing both architectural decisions and problem-solving insights.

> Every major shift‚Äîbe it in stack design, integration issues, or system architecture‚Äîis documented here for future reference and reproducibility.

--- 

### ‚öôÔ∏è  [config](https://github.com/SEAME-pt/JetPackJoyRide/tree/main/config)

This directory contains setup and service configuration files for both the Jetson Nano and the Raspberry Pi, enabling smooth deployment and reproducibility across the team.
